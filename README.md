# Overview

This is a simple hello world program that is the start of a large portfolio of software
That I have made. This specific project serves the purpose of making sure that all my software
is up to date and installed properly onto my device and connected to github.

This is a simple Python Program that prints "hello world" to the console

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment


The tools that I used to make this program are
- VSCode (Visual Studio Code)
- Python
-Git


I used python to write this program. It is a very easy to learn programming language as it is written and is similar to modern language using words like print for commands. It is also very commonly seen in machine learning with the tensor flow library or used by more than just software developers to handle and process data.
